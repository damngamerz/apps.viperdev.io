## What is an MVP?

An [MVP (Minimum Viable Product)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27809/minimum-viable-product-mvp) is the minimal solution to test your business assumption or satisfy your users.

For every feature that you think you need, ask yourself: *is this feature absolutely necessary to solve the problem for my users*?

If the answer is no, drop it.

Our MVP philosophy is what allows us to create apps for our clients at a minimal investment.
